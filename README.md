# Image-processing-using-artificial-inteligence
Python project that analyzes a real time-footage using image processing, to detect objects using a machine learning algorithm to be applied in a industry to detect the use of security equipment.

## Introduction
This programa analyzes either a video or a web-cam to recognize if there are any person in the footage, and if those persons are using security equipment, which is reduced to only a security helmet. 

## How it works

This program uses python, along with some of the most popular libraries of machine learning and data analysis. This include OpenCV, TensorFlow, Yolov4, numpy and pandas. It uses a machine learning trained neural network that finds the elements in each frame of the recording, and displays them in real time. It sends a alarm in case there a detection of a security risk, for example, someone without a helmet. This program was made with knowledge in OOP, machine learning and image analysis. 

## How to use it

You can see the main in the file "ejecutable.py", and all the dependencies must be downloaded in the following google drive file: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nc_uMK0u35CunyXNjPZFeYcor8HP59ri?usp=sharing

to run the program one must connect an external usb-camera, in any port. Also it requires to install all the libraries required. You can see a video of the functioning in the following link, or in the same folder as the resources:
